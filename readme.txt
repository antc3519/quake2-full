"This mod provides parkour abilities like climbing, double jumping, gliding, 
power sliding, and grappling! There are also checkpoints and a timer/scoreboard
for the player. Have fun! 

Press G to glide, C to power slide, and Q to grapple. To wall climb you only need
to walk up to a wall and hold space, and to double jump you need to press space 
while in the air.

There is a checkpoint system implemented which is in the form of monsters.
Every time you touch a monster you unlock a new checkpoint, and when you reach 5
you get given the time it took you to do so.

There are also 3 classes available that change your movespeed, jumpspeed, and a few
other stats. These classes can be changed by typing in the console the following:

class1	=  Rabbit
class2	=  Bear
class3	=  Cat

*Also adds monsters to deathmatch, and class system will only work in deathmatch*
